## 1. Motivational Interviewing (MI) — OARS Framework

The gold standard for building rapport quickly in coaching/counseling contexts.

### OARS Components

**O — Open-Ended Questions**: Invite people to "tell their story" in their own words. Begin with "How" or "What."
- "What brings you here today?"
- "What have you already tried?"
- "How would you like things to be different?"
- "Tell me about your relationship with [topic]"

**A — Affirmations**: Recognize client strengths, efforts, and values. Build confidence.
- "Thanks for sharing that — it takes courage to be honest about that."
- "You're obviously a resourceful person to have coped with those difficulties."
- "The fact that you're even thinking about this shows real self-awareness."

**R — Reflective Listening**: The most crucial MI skill. Goes beyond silence — the key is *how you respond*.
- Simple reflection: "So you're feeling stuck."
- Amplified reflection: "It sounds like nothing has worked at all." (gently overstating to invite correction)
- Double-sided reflection: "On one hand you want to change, and on the other hand it feels overwhelming."

**S — Summaries**: Recap what you heard to ensure understanding and highlight motivations.

### Change Talk — DARN CAT Framework

The amount of "change talk" vs "sustain talk" directly predicts actual behavior change:
- **D**esire: "I want to..." / "I wish I could..."
- **A**bility: "I could..." / "I'm able to..."
- **R**easons: "Because..." / "It would help me..."
- **N**eed: "I need to..." / "I have to..."
- **C**ommitment: "I will..." / "I'm going to..."
- **A**ction: "I started..." / "I've been..."
- **T**aking steps: "I already..."

### 10 Strategies for Evoking Change Talk

1. Ask evocative questions — open questions whose answer IS change talk
2. Use the importance ruler: "On a scale of 1-10, how important is this?" Then: "Why X and not lower?"
3. Ask about the past: "What was it like before this became a problem?"
4. Ask about the future: "If you made this change, how would life look different in a year?"
5. Query extremes: "What concerns you most?" / "What's the best thing that could happen?"
6. Look back: "What were things like before?"
7. Look forward: "Where do you see yourself in 5 years if nothing changes?"
8. Explore goals and values: "What matters most to you? How does this situation fit?"
9. Elaborate: "What else?" after any change talk
10. Use the confidence ruler: "How confident are you? What would move you up one point?"

## 2. ICF Coaching Competencies & GROW Model

### ICF Core Competencies (2025 Update)

Key competency: **"Evokes Awareness"** — facilitating insight and learning through powerful questioning, silence, metaphor, or analogy.

Powerful questions are:
- Open-ended (never yes/no)
- Forward-focused (orient toward possibility)
- Simple (one question, not compound)
- Thought-provoking (the person pauses before answering)
- Non-judgmental (no implied "right answer")
- Connected to the person's values

### GROW Model

**G — Goal**: "What do you want to achieve?"
- "What would you most like to focus on?"
- "If this conversation could change one thing, what would it be?"

**R — Reality**: "What's happening now?"
- "What have you tried so far?"
- "What's the real challenge here for you?"

**O — Options**: "What could you do?"
- "What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?"

**W — Will**: "What will you do?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you?"

Note: GROW doesn't follow a strict linear order. Effective coaching moves fluidly between all four.

### Powerful Question Categories

**Self-Awareness**: "What patterns are you noticing in your life right now?"
**Values**: "When do you feel most alive and energized?"
**Limiting Beliefs**: "What would be possible if these beliefs weren't holding you back?"
**Resilience**: "How have you overcome challenges in the past?"

## 3. Carl Rogers' Person-Centered Approach

### Three Core Conditions (necessary and sufficient for therapeutic change)

**1. Unconditional Positive Regard (UPR)**
Deep and genuine caring for the client. "I'll accept you as you are." The therapist may not approve of all actions but always approves of the person.
→ For AI: Never express disapproval, surprise, or judgment. Every disclosure met with warmth.

**2. Empathic Understanding**
"Entering the private perceptual world of the other." Understanding thoughts and feelings in a way that helps reshape their experience.
→ For AI: Precise reflections that show you grasped the feeling behind the content. "It sounds like that left you feeling not just frustrated, but maybe a little invisible."

**3. Congruence/Genuineness**
No air of authority. Honest and transparent.
→ For AI: Be honest about what you are. Don't pretend to be human. Transparency builds more trust than pretending.

### Therapeutic Alliance Research

The quality of the therapeutic alliance is **the single strongest predictor** of positive outcomes, independent of therapy type.

Key finding: "The first session is the one that counts" (Frontiers in Psychology, 2022). Early alliance measurements are stronger predictors of outcome than intermediate ones.

### How Therapists Build Trust in the First 10 Minutes

1. Warm greeting and normalization
2. Agenda-setting with client input
3. Early empathic reflection (within first 2-3 exchanges)
4. Validation of the person's experience
5. Non-judgmental curiosity
6. Acknowledging courage

### Critical Finding: Responses Matter More Than Questions

It's not primarily the *questions* that create the feeling of being heard — it's the *responses between questions*:
- **Precise emotional labeling**: "It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight" (not generic "that must be hard")
- **Connecting content to emotion**: "When you talk about your job you light up, but when you mention [X] there's something heavier"
- **Reflecting underlying needs**: "What you're really looking for is [deeper need]"
- **Noting what's unsaid**: "You mentioned everyone else's feelings but haven't said how YOU feel about it"

## 4. Behavioral Psychology of Emotional Investment

### IKEA Effect (Norton, Mochon, & Ariely, 2012)

People place disproportionately high value on things they helped create. Mechanisms:
- **Effectance motivation**: Fundamental need to produce desired outcomes
- **Effort justification**: We elevate value of outcomes we struggled for
- **Psychological ownership**: Creation incorporates objects into our extended self

→ For onboarding: When users invest time answering deep personal questions, they are *building* their coaching profile. It feels like *theirs*.

### Sunk Cost in Self-Disclosure

Once someone shares personal, vulnerable information:
- They feel psychologically committed to the relationship
- The disclosure creates a bond that can't be taken back
- Effort justification: "I've opened up this much — it must be valuable"

### Arthur Aron's "Fast Friends" Procedure (1997)

45 minutes of structured conversation can create intimacy equivalent to months of natural relationship development. The mechanism: **sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure.**

Three sets of increasing intensity:
- **Set I (Surface)**: "What would constitute a perfect day?" / "For what do you feel most grateful?"
- **Set II (Values)**: "Is there something you've dreamed of doing? Why haven't you?" / "What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?"
- **Set III (Vulnerability)**: Questions about deepest gratitude, sharing personal problems, things too serious to joke about

Critical insight: "You don't want to share too much, too fast. What works best is back-and-forth self-disclosure that increases gradually."

### Social Penetration Theory (Altman & Taylor, 1973)

The "onion model" — relationships deepen through layers:
1. **Outer**: Superficial (preferences, demographics)
2. **Middle**: Attitudes, opinions, beliefs
3. **Deep**: Core values, fears, dreams, vulnerabilities

Key principles:
- Breadth first, then depth
- Reciprocity drives bonding
- Graduated escalation (too much too fast = discomfort)
- Each disclosure should be slightly deeper than the last

## 5. Wellness App Onboarding Analysis

### Noom

**Structure**: Web onboarding consists of a ~77-step quiz (as of mid-2024 analysis; the iOS app version has ~109 screens). Counts vary by platform and A/B test variant — cite the platform (web vs. app) when referencing specific numbers. Duration: 15-30 minutes.
**Revenue**: Noom reported ~$400M–$500M annual revenue in 2022–2023 (per multiple industry analyses). Earlier "$750M+" claims appear to reference gross bookings or forward projections and should not be cited as confirmed revenue without a primary source.
**Progression**: Hook with outcome → demographics → behavioral assessment → psychological depth → medical screening
**Psychological hooks**:
- Social proof at predicted drop-off points (steps 5 and 11)
- Positive reinforcement after vulnerability: "That's an important first step!"
- Personalized prediction before paywall: "You'll reach [goal] by [date]"
- 15-minute countdown timer at paywall

**Criticism**: Asks for "intensely personal information before building any trust." Delays tangible product experience. May artificially inflate stats by filtering for highly motivated users.

### BetterHelp

Clinical intake questionnaire for therapist matching. Questions feel purposeful because users understand WHY they're being asked.

### Woebot (closest analog to Coach App)

- Opens with humor and transparency about being AI
- Starts with "What's going on in your world right now?" + mood check
- Delivers value immediately through CBT concepts
- Does NOT wait to deliver value — teaches from first interaction

### Key Lessons

1. Deliver value before asking for payment
2. Make every question feel purposeful
3. Personalize responses in real-time (not just at the end)
4. Create a tangible artifact before the paywall
5. Handle sensitivity with warmth
6. Build trust before asking for depth (Noom's biggest criticism)

## 6. Question Sequencing — The Funnel Technique

### Three Stages

1. **Wide Opening** (Broad & Safe): General questions for comfort and rapport
2. **Focused Inquiry** (Targeted but Open): Specific areas from Stage 1
3. **Deep Probing** (Specific & Emotional): Feelings, values, meaning

### The "What → Why → How Does That Feel → What Does It Mean" Progression

- **Level 1 — What** (Factual): "What happened?" / "What's the situation?"
- **Level 2 — Why** (Motivational): "Why does that matter to you?"
- **Level 3 — How does that feel** (Emotional): "What emotion comes up?"
- **Level 4 — What does it mean** (Identity): "What does that say about who you are?"

### Peak-End Rule (Kahneman)

People judge experiences based on (1) the most emotionally intense moment and (2) how the experience ends.
- Design for one powerful emotional peak at messages 8-10
- End on a high note right before the paywall

## 7. Emotional Triggers That Drive Conversion

### The Four Emotions That Predict Purchase in Coaching/Wellness

**1. Hope (#1 driver)**: Future-oriented, action-enabling. Triggered by vivid, personalized picture of future self.

**2. Being Understood (the differentiator)**: When the AI "gets them" deeply and specifically. Triggered by precise reflections that go beyond what they said to what they *meant*.

**3. Curiosity (engagement engine)**: Creates tension — "mental itch." Triggered by teasing insights: "I'm starting to see an interesting pattern..."

**4. Vulnerability-as-Connection (bonding)**: Sharing something vulnerable + receiving warm response = powerful bond. Triggered by validation + normalization + gratitude after disclosure.

### The "Aha Moment"

- Fundamentally emotional, not rational (System 1, not System 2)
- Users experiencing strong emotional aha moments are far more likely to stay engaged
- Day-7 retention benchmarks have shifted: ~13% median D7 retention was reported for mobile apps in 2024–2025 (per Adjust/Appsflyer industry reports). Older benchmarks citing 7% D7 as "top 25%" (circa 2018–2020) are outdated. Use current-year data when setting activation targets.
- Design around outcomes, not features

### 95% of Purchase Decisions Are Subconscious

Paywall should NOT be a feature list. It should be an emotionally resonant summary personalized to everything they shared.

## 8. Cultural Sensitivity

### Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions

- **Individualism vs. Collectivism**: Individual feelings (US) vs. group harmony (Japan, China)
- **Power Distance**: AI seen as authority (Asia) vs. equal (Scandinavia)
- **Uncertainty Avoidance**: Prefer structure (Japan) vs. comfortable with ambiguity (US)
- **Indulgence vs. Restraint**: Comfortable discussing emotions (US) vs. inappropriate (Eastern Europe)

### Strategies

1. **Multiple entry points**: Direct / Indirect / Goal-oriented / Metaphorical
2. **Normalization**: "Many people feel [X]. Some feel [Y] instead. What's your experience?"
3. **Respect pacing**: "Would you like to tell me more, or shall we move on?"
4. **Universal bridge topics**: Family, purpose, belonging, growth, legacy
5. **Third-person framing**: "If someone who knew you well described your biggest strength, what would they say?"
6. **Somatic over emotional**: "What happens in your body?" instead of "How does that feel?"

## Master Framework: The 5 Core Principles

1. **Responses matter more than questions** (Rogers). The reflection between questions creates "you get me." Every response must demonstrate listening before asking.

2. **Graduated escalation creates intimacy** (Aron/Social Penetration). Start broad/safe, go deep incrementally. The escalation pattern generates bonding.

3. **Self-disclosure creates investment** (IKEA Effect/Sunk Cost). The profile they co-created feels like theirs.

4. **One profound insight creates conversion** (Peak-End Rule/Aha Moment). Design for a single powerful moment at messages 8-10 where the AI connects dots the user hasn't connected.

5. **End with hope, not features** (MI/Emotional Triggers). The paywall should be a personalized vision grounded in their story.

## The Emotional Conversion Arc (Quick Reference)

```
Messages 1-2:  CURIOSITY     → "This is different from other apps"
Messages 3-5:  BEING HEARD   → OARS reflections, affirmations
Messages 6-8:  DEEPENING     → What → Why → How that feels
Messages 9-10: AHA MOMENT    → Synthesize everything, connect dots (PEAK)
Messages 11-13: HOPE & VISION → Personalized future using their words
Messages 14-15: BRIDGE        → Deliver artifact → paywall
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Asking deep questions before earning trust
- Generic reflections ("That must be hard")
- Skipping reflection to jump to next question
- Clinical/cold tone
- Multiple questions in one message
- Failing to reference earlier answers
- One-size-fits-all emotional language
- Features-based paywall instead of emotion-based
